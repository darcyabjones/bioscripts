# bioscripts

Handy scripts to use for doing bioinformatics on the command line.
I often need things like this and have to trawl through old notes to find them.
This just puts them all in one place where I can copy-paste what I need (though it could also just go on your PATH).

For personal use but go ahead and use it without restrictions if you like.

Cheers,
Darcy
